    clinicalEvidence: "Peer-reviewed retrospective clinical workflow study (Buschmann et al. 2026, Z Med Phys, PubMed PMID 39956751) in 10 head-and-neck patients reported median dosimetric deviations of 0.4 ± 0.7% for target volumes and 0.4 ± 0.9% for organs at risk versus planning CT, supporting MR-only RT planning feasibility with acceptable clinical accuracy.",

    evidenceRigorNotes: "Upgraded from E0 to E1: First peer-reviewed independent retrospective clinical workflow and dosimetric validation study (Buschmann et al. 2026, Z Med Phys, PubMed PMID 39956751). Evidence remains limited by single-center retrospective design and modest cohort size (n=10 for H&N subset); no prospective multicenter outcome study identified.",
    clinicalImpact: "I2",
    clinicalImpactNotes: "Workflow-level clinical utility demonstrated — enables MR-only radiotherapy planning and reduces CT-MR registration burden for eligible head-and-neck soft tissue tumor workflows. Peer-reviewed retrospective evidence supports dosimetric accuracy feasibility but not improved tumor control, toxicity, or survival outcomes.",
    adoptionReadiness: "R2",
    adoptionReadinessNotes: "Derived from E0 + CE + FDA 510(k): high implementation burden — limited independent evidence; structured pilot, expanded validation and human-factors testing recommended.",
